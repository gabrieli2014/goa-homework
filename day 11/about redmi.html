<p> Redmi (stylized in all caps) is a subsidiary brand owned by the Chinese electronics company Xiaomi. It was first launched in July 2013 as a budget smartphone line,[1] and became a separate sub-brand of Xiaomi in 2019, to takeover entry-level and mid-range devices originally produced by Xiaomi brand, while Xiaomi itself produces upper-range and flagship Xiaomi (formerly Mi) phones.

    Redmi phones use Xiaomi's MIUI or HyperOS user interface on top of Android. Models are divided into the entry-level Redmi, the mid-range Redmi Note, and the high-end Redmi K. In 2022, a lower-priced entry-level lineup, Redmi A was introduced, featuring Android Go and lacking MIUI user interface.
    
    The most significant difference from other Xiaomi smartphones is that Redmi uses less expensive components, allowing lower prices while retaining more advanced specifications. In August 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that in the second quarter of the 2014 fiscal year, Xiaomi had a smartphone market share of 14% in China;[2] Redmi sales were attributed as a contributing factor toward this ranking.[2]
    
    Some phones with identical specification are released in some markets as POCO, in others as Redmi; for example the Poco X7 and Redmi Note 14 Pro 5G.</p>
