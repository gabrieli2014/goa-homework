Xiaomi was founded in 2010 in Beijing by Lei Jun along with six associates. Lei had worked at Kingsoft as an executive and been involved in the founding and management of Joyo.com, the latter of which was sold to Amazon for $75 million in 2004. In August 2011, Xiaomi released its first smartphone and by 2014 it had the largest market share of smartphones sold in China. Initially the company only sold its products online; however, it later opened brick and mortar stores.[8] By 2015, it was developing a wide range of consumer electronics.[9] In 2020, the company sold 149.4 million smartphones and its MIUI (now Xiaomi HyperOS) mobile operating system has over 500 million monthly active users.[10] As of August 2024, Xiaomi is the second-largest seller of smartphones worldwide, with a market share of about 12%, according to Counterpoint.[11] It has come up with its own range of wearable items.[12] It also is a major manufacturer of appliances including televisions, flashlights, unmanned aerial vehicles, and air purifiers using its Internet of things and Xiaomi Smart Home product ecosystems.
Xiaomi keeps its prices close to its manufacturing and bill of materials costs by keeping most of its products in the market for 18 months, longer than most smartphone companies.[13][14] The company also uses inventory optimization and flash sales to keep its inventory low.[15][8]</p>
